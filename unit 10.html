     Wow! am I right? Just look at that man right there. What a star! Who can deny his god like being. He is one sexy mofo! David has taken his rightful place here with us mortals. He has expanded our human culture ten fold! (Check out some of his pieces in the works section) A few examples are Baywatch, Baywatch: Hawiian wedding, and Baywatch: White Thunder and Glacier Bay. However, His most inportant works was Spongebob the Movie. Not only movies, but he can also sing.
